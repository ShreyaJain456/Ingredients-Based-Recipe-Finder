# Ingredients-Based-Recipe-Finder

It is mobile application that helps to search recipes based on ingredients which  are currently present with users. It provides us option to choose category : vegetarian or non-vegetarian and will search all the recipes from one stored in its database and will display those are possible through selected ingredients. Also user can view all the recipes by clicking on recipe collection in navigation drawer. Since all the pdf files are stored in firebase so in marshmallow user has to explicitly go to settings and have to provide storage permission to this app otherwise pdf files would not be downloaded. Also stable internet connection is required to download or see list of recipes since all these details are being fetched from firebase. 

Currently I have uploaded only 3 recipes. So if you choose :
  -   milk or/and yogurt in vegetarian  
  -  milk or/and egg in non-vegetarian

the list of relevant recipes are available. User can click and download them.
